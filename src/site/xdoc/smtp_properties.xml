    <section name="SMTP properties">
      The SMTP properties allow you to adjust the SMTP-server(s) and -port the
      user can connect to. You may want to limit the choice of your users to
      prevent them from sending spam via your application-server.

      <p>SMTP-host-choice "free":
      <br/>
      The user will be allowed to choose any SMTP-server for his mail to be
      send. This setting should be handled with care, since users could abuse
      your application-server to send spam.
      </p>

      <p>SMTP-host-choice "domain" (default):
      <br/>
      The user will be allowed to choose a SMTP-server within the domain of the
      mailbox-host (for example if the user has a mailbox host "pop.domain.tld",
      he will be able to choose a SMTP-server within the domain "domain.tld").
      This considerably reduces the the users chance to send spam by dint of
      your server.
      </p>

      <p>SMTP-host-choice "none":
      <br/>
      The user can only use the SMTP-host you allow. With this setting you also
      have to specify the properties "forced_smtp_host_name" and
      "forced_smtp_host_port".
      </p>

      <h4>Howto change SMTP properties</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>Deploy yawebmail.war</li>
        <li>
          Your Servlet-container will unpack the yawebmail.war into a normal
          directory (Tomcat will create "TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/yawebmail/").
        </li>
        <li>
          Change into the created directory. If you can't find it, undeploy the
          WAR-file and unpack it by yourself ("jar -xf yawebmail.war").
        </li>
        <li>
          Change into "WEB-INF/classes/de/lotk/yawebmail/properties/" and open
          "smtp.properties" with your favorite text-editor.
        </li>
        <li>
          The settings within "smtp.properties" are self-describing. Change
          them to your desired values. Don't forget to save the changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Restart your Servlet-container (or re-pack and re-deploy your modified
          WAR-file if you chose the "unpack yourself"-approach).
        </li>
      </ol>
