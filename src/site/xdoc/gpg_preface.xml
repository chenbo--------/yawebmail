      This is about how to sign and verify as well as to en- and decrypt
      messages with GPG (the free software replacement for the PGP suite). To
      understand how signing and encryption of eMails work, there are many
      webpages you can study (for example
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard"
      target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard</a>).

      <p>Even though there may be other ways, this howto suggests the use of
      FireGPG because of its ease of use. The according requirements are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A GPG-installation (<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/"
        target="_blank">http://www.gnupg.org/</a>)</li>
        <li>Firefox (<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/"
        target="_blank">http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/</a>)</li>
        <li>FireGPG (<a href="http://firegpg.tuxfamily.org/"

      Sign and decrypt messages:
      <br/>
      Before you can sign messages (and retrieve encrypted ones) you got to
      generate a private/public-keypair. On the command-line, type
      <br/>
      <code>gpg --gen-key</code>
      <br/>
      and follow the instructions given. Than export your public key to a file
      via
      <br/>
      <code>gpg -a --export your-email-address@provider.tld > pubkey.asc</code>
      <br/>
      and put it on your webpage so that mail-recipients can verify your
      signature und use it to encrypt their messages to you.
      <br/><br/>

      Encrypt and verify messages:
      <br/>
      Before you can encrypt outgoing and verify incomming messages you got to
      import the recipients/senders public key via:
      <br/>
      <code>gpg --import pubkey-of-recipient.asc</code>
      <br/>
