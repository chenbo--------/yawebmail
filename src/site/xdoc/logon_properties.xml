    <section name="Logon properties">
      If you are planning to provide yawebmail to a closed circle of users and
      only want to use them a specific mail-server you can adjust the logon
      properties in these ways:

      <p>Port-numbers:
      <br/>
      The POP3- and IMAP-port-numbers yawebmail uses to connect.
      </p>

      <p>Preselected mailbox-host:
      <br/>
      Preselect a specific mailbox-host to connect to.
      </p>

      <p>Force preselected mailbox-host:
      <br/>
      Users will not be able to change the mailbox-host to connect to. The
      preselected one will be enforced.
      </p>

      <p>Preselected mailbox-protocol:
      <br/>
      Preselect a specific mailbox-protocol to connect with.
      </p>

      <p>Force preselected mailbox-protocol:
      <br/>
      Users will not be able to change the mailbox-protocol to connect with. The
      preselected one will be enforced.
      </p>

      <h4>Howto change logon properties</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>Deploy yawebmail.war</li>
        <li>
          Your Servlet-container will unpack the yawebmail.war into a normal
          directory (Tomcat will create "TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/yawebmail/").
        </li>
        <li>
          Change into the created directory. If you can't find it, undeploy the
          WAR-file and unpack it by yourself ("jar -xf yawebmail.war").
        </li>
        <li>
          Change into "WEB-INF/classes/de/lotk/yawebmail/properties/" and open
          "logon.properties" with your favorite text-editor.
        </li>
        <li>
          The settings within "logon.properties" are self-describing. Change
          them to your desired values. Don't forget to save the changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Restart your Servlet-container (or re-pack and re-deploy your modified
          WAR-file if you chose the "unpack yourself"-approach).
        </li>
      </ol>
