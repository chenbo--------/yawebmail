    <section name="Translate language-file">
      To add a new language to yawebmail, you only need to translate one file
      into the desired language.

      <p>Within the WAR-archive* you find the directory
      <br/><br/>

      "WEB-INF/classes/de/lotk/yawebmail/properties/"
      <br/><br/>

      where several language-files are located (e.g. "view_en.properties" or
      "view_de.properties"). The two letters previous to the dot conform to the
      ISO-language-code
      (<a href="http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt"
              target="_blank">List of ISO-language-codes</a>).
      <br/>
      Make a copy of any language-file into the target-file
      "view_#language-code#.properties" into the same directory and do the
      translations.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section name="Mail and/or add the language-file">
      The simplest way is to mail the translated file to the eMail-Address found
      in the language-files. It will be adopted into the next release of
      yawebmail then.

      <p>If you don't want to wait, you can add the language-file yourself
      (in this case please mail the translation anyway, so others can take
      advantage of your work, too):
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          If not happened yet, copy the translated file into the
          language-file-directory (see above).
        </li>
        <li>
          Within the directory "WEB-INF" you find the file "myfaces-config.xml".
          Add a new "supported-locale" entry under "locale-config" there.
        </li>
        <li>Restart your Servlet-container.</li>
